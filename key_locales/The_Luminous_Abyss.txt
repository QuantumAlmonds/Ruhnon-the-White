# The Luminous Abyss

## Location
Deep within the underdark beneath the ravine

## Description
Deep within the underdark lies a vast cavern where bioluminescent fungi and crystals create a false sky of ghostly light. This underground realm is home to a society of exiles who have created a culture based on radical honesty - in the darkness, they believe, all pretenses must be abandoned. The cavern houses the Well of Essence - a pool of liquid magical energy that, when drunk, strips away all magical disguises and forces one to confront their true self. The residents have developed unique magic that draws power from self-acceptance rather than external sources. Ruhnon occasionally visits to study their techniques, though few surface dwellers know of this connection.
